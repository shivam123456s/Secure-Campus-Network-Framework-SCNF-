The Secure Campus Network Framework (SCNF) is a hands-on academic project that shows how to build a secure, scalable campus network using today’s best networking and security practices.

Here’s the idea: imagine a campus split into departments—Admin, Faculty, Students, Library, Server Room, and Security Room. Each one sits on its own VLAN. That keeps things tidy and adds a real boost to security and network speed. DHCP handles IP addresses automatically, so there’s no headache with manual setup. For traffic between VLANs, I went with the classic Router-on-a-Stick method.

Security gets top billing. Access Control Lists (ACLs) block any unauthorized traffic between departments. And to really test the setup, I ran an ethical hacking simulation. Using tools like Kali Linux, Nmap, Nikto, Metasploit, and Wireshark, I poked and prodded for vulnerabilities—inside a safe, controlled environment, of course. Any weak spots I found led straight to targeted security recommendations for the network.

This whole project ties together knowledge from Ethical Hacking, Advanced Cyber Security (CTP), Software Project Management (SPM), and IT Acts & Cyber Laws. It’s a full-on interdisciplinary effort.
